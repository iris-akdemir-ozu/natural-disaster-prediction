Creating a Deep Learning Prediction System within a Web Framework for Natural Disaster Prediction
o Description: This system will utilize deep learning models to automatically generate predictions based on images or maps that represent natural disaster data, such as flood zones or hurricane paths. It should function similarly to the "Machine Learning for Predictive Maps in Python and Leaflet" tutorial, providing predictions on disaster risks and severity.
o Keywords: Deep Learning, Web Framework, Image Prediction, Natural Disaster,
Map Prediction, Python, Leaflet
o Task: Develop a web-based system that takes input images or maps (and uses deep learning techniques) to generate predictions regarding natural disaster risks, such as flooding or hurricane intensity.
